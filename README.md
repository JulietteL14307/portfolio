Juliette Lee's Portfolio

Hello, hello world! (;

I'm Juliette and I'm glad to have you here.

This site should serve as my portfolio for all of my development work, artwork, and maybe any other stuff I work on!

(I like building things(woodshop, crafts, paintings, you name it!))

Anyways, I hope that you enjoy my portfolio. 

I'm writing this before I've written any single line of code, but I know I'm going to work hard on it to make it as unique as I am.

Let's get to it!
